Space Invader Game
This is a Space Invader Game created using Python Turtle. It features the space_up.py file, which includes updated functionality.

The space_up.py file uses the winsound module for Windows and the os module for Linux/Mac to handle sound. If you are using Linux/Mac, uncomment the sound-related lines for your operating system and comment out the Windows-specific lines. Clear instructions are provided in the code.

The game requires the Python Turtle module and either the winsound (for Windows) or os (for Linux/Mac) module. Ensure these modules are installed to avoid errors.

To install the Turtle module, use the following command:

For installing Turtle Module use command :
```
    pip install turtles
```
